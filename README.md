## Project Overview
This repository contains the implementation of the Avondi landing page based on the provided Figma design. The implementation focuses on creating a responsive, interactive webpage that matches the design specifications while ensuring good performance and maintainability.

## Development Process

### Day 1 (Friday): Foundation and Structure
I began by establishing the desktop foundation with a comprehensive analysis of the design and breaking down the components. Initially, I structured all styling in a single CSS file to get a clear picture of the elements and their relationships. As the complexity grew, I refactored the code into multiple CSS files organized by component, which significantly improved code manageability and maintainability.

Key accomplishments:
- HTML structure setup and semantic markup
- Initial CSS architecture planning
- Component-based file organization
- Basic responsive grid implementation

### Day 2 (Saturday): Desktop Implementation
The focus was on completing the desktop view with all its interactive elements. I implemented the image carousel, the changing background colors on hover in the "Deliver smarter, not harder" section, and the news slider functionality.

Key accomplishments:
- Desktop layout completion
- Interactive elements implementation
- JavaScript functionality for carousel and sliders
- Hover state implementations

### Day 3 (Sunday): Mobile Optimization and Refinement
I dedicated this day to creating the mobile view while ensuring the desktop experience remained intact. This involved implementing the specific mobile components like the "What & Why Avondi?" section, adjusting layouts, and ensuring a consistent experience across devices.

Key accomplishments:
- Mobile-specific component implementation
- Responsive breakpoints refinement
- Cross-device testing and adjustments
- Final polishing and performance optimization

## Time Investment
- Friday: 4 hours (Foundation and planning)
- Saturday: 6 hours (Desktop implementation)
- Sunday: 6 hours (Mobile implementation and refinement)
- **Total: 16 hours**

## Technical Challenges and Solutions

The most significant challenge was implementing the dynamic background color changes in the "Deliver smarter, not harder" section when hovering over different cards. This required careful planning of the CSS transitions and JavaScript event listeners to create a smooth, visually appealing effect. The solution involved creating specific state classes that are toggled based on user interaction, with carefully crafted CSS transitions to ensure smooth color changes.

It was really fun to work on this interactive element :) 

## Limitations and Future Improvements

While the implementation successfully meets the core requirements for desktop and mobile views, there are some minor display inconsistencies on tablet-sized devices and very large screens. Given more time, I would:

1. Implement more granular media queries for various tablet breakpoints
2. Create additional optimizations for ultra-wide displays
3. Further refine the animation performance on lower-end devices
4. Implement additional accessibility features

## Conclusion

This implementation demonstrates my attention to detail and commitment to creating high-quality, responsive web experiences. The component-based architecture ensures maintainability, while the careful implementation of interactive elements provides an engaging user experience that aligns with the provided design specifications.
